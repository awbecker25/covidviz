# Maryland COVID-19 Maps

The included jupyter notebook creates two choropleth, natural breaks maps of Maryland counties: 
  1. Total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the period between 1/22/2020 and 5/7/2020
  2. Confirmed COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 in the period between 1/22/2020 and 5/7/2020
  
 
Repository files:
  1. "COVID-19 MD County Choropleths.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook containing the Python3 code
  2. "mdcounty2018pop.csv" is a dataset containing ACS 5-year estimates for 2018 total population of each Maryland county
  3. "ratemap.png" is an image file created by the code. It shows a map of incidence rates by county, which account for differences in county populations
  4. "totalcasemap.png" is an image file created by the code. It shows a map of total cases by county
